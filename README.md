## About

`changelog-sv-action` is a GitHub action for generating a changelog based on
the [standard-version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard-version) npm package. The purpose of this action is to
automate the process of generating changelogs for software projects.

Maintaining a clear and concise changelog is an important aspect of software development, as it allows users and
contributors to easily understand what changes have been made in each version of the software. However, manually
creating and maintaining a changelog can be a time-consuming and error-prone task.

This action solves the problem of generating changelogs by automating the process using the `standard-version` package.
It can detect new versions or get a version from the GitHub Action inputs, and it validates the input version to ensure
that it is not equal to or less than the current version. The action also allows for errors to be ignored using the
action inputs.

The `changelog-sv-action` generates a new changelog, updates the `CHANGELOG.md` file, and returns only the new section
as a GitHub Action output. It also returns the new version as `version`. This action only updates the `CHANGELOG.md`
file so that a pull request can be created in other steps if desired.

By automating the process of generating changelogs, this action helps to save time and reduce errors. It also ensures
that the changelog is consistent and up-to-date, which is important for maintaining a transparent and well-documented
software project.
